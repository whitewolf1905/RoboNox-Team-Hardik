The working explanation of a package delivery system which comprises of a slider with a set of servo motors to slide the coming package from the truck with a barcode scanner attached at the top to sort the package into respective pin code cart. At the end of the 3 way slider, there are 3 bots facing towards their respective carts. As one of the bots is filled with a package, the weight sensor will act as a signal to stop sorting and the bot with the package will move towards its respective cart, deliver the package and will reverse back to its original position and sorting mechanism will resume.
